# Meditation

_28 Jul 2025_

Initially, I didnâ€™t plan on writing today. However, something has been on my mind, and I find that meditating on such thoughts often brings clarity. By reflecting on my ideas and feelings, I can delve into my past, seeking answers and understanding.

The past few days have been incredibly enriching in terms of growth and learning. I feel more capable than ever of expressing my ideas and emotions. This made me wonder if I could transfer this newfound confidence to my professional life. It's crucial to express oneself clearly and professionally in the real world.

I realized my reluctance to write stemmed from a lack of encouragement, both from my parents and my teachers. In high school, writing often felt like a tedious obligation rather than a way to develop self-expression. 

In job interviews, the ability to express oneself through writing is crucial. Employers first encounter you through your resume, social media profiles, and sometimes personal blogs. Strong writing skills can significantly increase your chances of landing an interview. Once hired, you will frequently communicate through emails, reports, and other written formats. Being comfortable with writing can make these tasks much easier.

Now, I can confidently write around 250 words. I've discovered a joy in writing that I never thought possible. Embracing this skill has been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to further developing my abilities.

That's it for now. I see you in a minute!
