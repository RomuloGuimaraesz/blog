# Trust Your Gut

_27 Jul 2025_

Expressing my current feelings seems insufficient by simply saying I'm happy, but with how things are unfolding, I couldn't feel any different. Not too long ago, I probably wouldn't have admitted this, worrying about some nonsense belief that keeping things low-key would ensure they worked out. But honestly? I don't mind anymore.
Even if things don’t work out, I'd still be happy. Sounds crazy, huh? The reason is simple: I'm trying! When things go wrong, it means the chosen path isn’t the right one, and there's always something to learn from that. But why am I talking about this?
The Udemy course I mentioned in my previous post has an overview section, and the first part reinforced my decision not only about buying this particular course but also about how I should prepare for the IELTS test.
When I started this blog, my thoughts were fixed on one specific thing: how much is enough? I mean, how much should I write every day to prepare for the IELTS test? My initial answer was at least 250 words!
With that in mind, every time I sat down to write a post, my minimum goal was to hit that word count, even if it meant spending a long time picking out words and ideas from my brain. So, what’s the big deal?
The instructor of the course presented the four parts of the test, and for the writing test, guess how many words are required for Task 2? You guessed it: 250! Bullseye, goddammit! I was surprised in so many ways. But to keep it short, here's the lesson I took from this: trust your gut!
Trusting my instincts was something I did naturally when I was younger, but I lost it as I got older and experienced setbacks. However, deep down, I knew I could get back to that mindset. Finally, I feel like that old, young me again.
That’s it. I wish everyone could experience this feeling! See you soon.
