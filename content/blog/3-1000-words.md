# 10³ Words

**20 Jul 2024**

Today's post marks the 1000 words achievement, hell yeah!<br>
Honestly, I was surprised about how fast it was to make at this point.
And it makes me wonder about the lack of notion I have when it comes to some tasks, it is joyful to accomplish this, and also makes the process much more pleasant as well.
I believe more in quality over quantity, and when it comes to this new goal I don’t know how to evaluate being able to write a thousand words, but without a question, I should have started earlier.
I feel more comfortable putting my thoughts in words now than I was in the first post, and I look forward to see how it will be after the first month.
Today and tomorrow I will be dedicated to organizing the materials like notebooks, folders and organization apps to set the routine I intend to be following for the next months to be able to stick to the plot and build the capacity to take the test in the future with confidence.
Setting a goal and committing to this blog was one of the best choices I ever made, and reminds me of how I used to be not so much time ago.
The funniest thing is that planning to achieve something in the future makes us connect the dots related to the past.
Anyway, maybe it is true that everything happens for a reason.
That’s it for today.
I see you in a minute!
