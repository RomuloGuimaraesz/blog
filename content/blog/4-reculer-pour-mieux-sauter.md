# Reculer Pour Mieux Sauter #
(Retreat to jump further)

**21 Jul 2024**


Today was a busy day!<br>
I took the day to clean up my room and organize my things, and the goal was not to rush.<br>
It's important to take time with some tasks because it will be a waste of energy if you need to redo them later on.<br>
It has become clear to me that for time-consuming tasks, it's crucial to create a favorable environment. Even so, I maintained regular tasks like taking my meals at the usual times to keep my routine intact.<br>
Of course, it wasn't the most exciting day, but dedicating more time to what matters most afterward is necessary.<br>
I accomplished more than I planned, and this kind of achievement makes me feel proud.<br>
At this stage of my life, I want to be more cautious about the energy I spend because if I use too much at once, I'll probably run out of gas soon.<br>
And who wants that?<br>
I knew I had a spare notebook somewhere for my IELTS studies, but to my surprise, I found two. Taking the time to get things right before diving into my test studies will be super beneficial down the road.<br>
Discipline is important, but it should be accompanied by accountability; otherwise, it feels like an empty gesture.<br>
Maybe I'm digressing a little... but honestly, I was thinking of not doing anything on weekends to avoid becoming demotivated.<br>
However, accountability hit my conscience, and here I am, showing up.<br>
That's it for now. See you in a minute!
