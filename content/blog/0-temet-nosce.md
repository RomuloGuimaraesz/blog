# Temet Nosce
_(Know thyself)_

17 Jul 2024

To be honest, I’m a super procrastinator. Not proud of it, but it’s true. Sometimes I avoid doing things for no reason, always convincing myself that I can do it at any time, so why bother now?<br>
Too much time passed before I realized that this was wrong. It's too pretentious to assume that I know how much time I have. Truth be told, I’m definitely not doing my best to be a better human being. Since I decided to be real for a change, it’s fair to say that I'm neither modest nor humble.<br>
This behavior is deeply related to the procrastination I have cultivated my whole life. Constantly fooling myself into thinking I can do anything because I’m dope. But then it hit me: maybe I’m not. Maybe what I really need is to be more down-to-earth and less egocentric. Life is passing by, the clock is ticking, and time is running out!<br>
Someone once told me, “Never settle for what is not good.” I don’t know if she knew how strong this statement was, but I did. It became one of my life's guiding values, one of my anchors, reminding me that things are constantly changing. So why shouldn’t I?<br>
The hardest part is facing ourselves, being honest through and through. Looking back, I was certain that I would never be a blogger. Starting this endeavor is my way to bring things to light, to work through them with cleverness, and by understanding them, understand myself... better.
From now on no more bullsh*t, thank you very much.
