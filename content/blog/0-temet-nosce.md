# Temet Nosce
_(Know thyself)_

17 Jul 2024

To be honest, **I’m a super procrastinator**. Not proud of it, but it’s true. Sometimes I avoid doing things for no reason. I always convince myself that I can do it at any time, so why bother now?<br>
Too much time passed before I realized that this was wrong. How could I know the time I have? I am definitely not doing the best I can to be a better human being. And since I decided to be real for a change, it’s fair to say that I am not the modest type either.<br>
This relates to the procrastination behavior that I have bred my whole life. Constantly fooling myself that I can do it... I’m freaking dope! No, I’m not. 
The clock is ticking, but time is up!<br>
Someone once said to me, “Never settle for what is not good.” I don’t know if she knew how strong this statement was, but I did. It became one of my life's guiding values, one of my anchors.<br>
The hardest part is facing ourselves, being honest through and through. Looking back, I was certain that I would never be a blogger. Well, maybe I was wrong.
From now on no more bullsh*t, thank you very much.
