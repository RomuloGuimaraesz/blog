# Temet Nosce

To be honest? I am a **super procastinator**.
Not proud of it... but it is true.
Sometimes I avoid doing things for no reason.
Always convince myself that I can do it any time, so why bother now?!
Too much time passed by to realize that this was wrong, how could I know how much time I have?
I am not doing the best I can to be a better human being.
Since I decided to be real for a change... it fair to say I am not the modest type either.
And it relates to the procrastination behavior that I have bred my whole life.
Always fooling myself that I can do it... I’m freaking dope! No... I’m not.
The clock is ticking, but time is up!
Someone once said to me: “Never be settled for what is not good”.
Don’t know if she knew how strong this **statement** was, but I did.
I took it as one of my life's guiding values, one of my anchors.
The hard part is facing ourselves, being honest... through and through.
Looking back, I was certain that would never be a blogger.
Well, maybe I was wrong.
For now on... no more bullsh*t, thank you very much.
