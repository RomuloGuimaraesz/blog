# Temet Nosce

**17 Jul 2024** |

To be honest? I am a **super procrastinator**.<br>
Not proud of it... but it is true.<br>
Sometimes I avoid doing things for no reason.
Always convince myself that I can do it any time, so why bother now?!<br>
Too much time passed by for me, to realize that this was wrong, how could I know how much time I have?<br>
I am not doing the best I can to be a better human being.<br>
Since I decided to be real for a change... it is fair to say I am not the modest type either.<br>
And it relates to the procrastination behavior that I have bred my whole life.<br>
Always fooling myself that I can do it... I’m freaking dope! No... I’m not.<br>
The clock is ticking, but time is up!<br>
Someone once said to me: “Never be settled for what is not good”.<br>
Don’t know if she knew how strong this **statement** was, but I did.<br>
I took it as one of my life's guiding values, one of my anchors.<br>
The hard part is facing ourselves, being honest... through and through.<br>
Looking back, I was certain that would never be a blogger.<br>
Well, maybe I was wrong.<br>
For now on... no more bullsh*t thank you very much!
