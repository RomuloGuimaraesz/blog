# That's fine, take a breath

_25 Jul 2024_

Today I was quieter than usual. I tried to stay focused and make some progress, but now, reflecting on what I did, I feel like it wasn’t much different from yesterday. I felt stuck. Even though I paid more attention to the documentation task that I mentioned in the previous post, it feels like I was busy but not productive.

One positive thing, though, gives me some motivation. Not too long ago, I would have likely turned my back for a couple of days and told myself I would give it more attention later. Instead, today I stayed in the zone, trying to figure out how to arrange this puzzle right. That lazy behavior was something I bred for too long, and now it feels like I am gaining control back.
Here is the summary report that I came up with today. I will share the detailed one later after I feel confident about it. So here it is:

Understand the type of questions:
    1. Opinion (Could be agreement or disagreement)
    2. Discussion (Like the opinion, could be in favor or against)
    3. Problem and Solution (Identify problems and discuss possible solutions)
    4. Advantages and Disadvantages (Highlight the possibilities given certain situations)
       
Essay Structure:
    1. Introduction
    2. Development
    3. Conclusion
       
Borrowing some techniques from the design thinking framework, I realize that it would be appropriate to brainstorm up to three ideas before I start writing. For this, 10 minutes seems pretty decent to me. At this stage, I will try to spend no more than 30 minutes on any idea.

I also realized that the resources for developing my repertoire will be most helpful for the examples and evidence I should present to support my arguments. My biggest struggle is with clarity and coherence. I feel deficient in this matter, which gave me insight into dedicating more attention to grammar to help me use some structures. I hope this will ensure more cohesion with the language.

I don’t know if all of this makes sense, but for now, it’s the path I intend to take. Practicing some mock tests will give me feedback on whether I’m on the right path or if I messed up.
That’s it, I see you in a minute.
