# There are no guarantees, only opportunities
_(V in V for Vendetta movie)_

**22 Jul 2024**

I was reasoning about how I postponed things, waiting for the right moment. That does not mean being reckless about them… (or maybe it was, who am I trying to fool?!). 
To overcome this fear of not being ready for something, an excellent strategy is to build confidence by doing what I fear, but in baby steps. 
I think this is safer and cleverer.
All of this preamble is to say that my approach to doing things has changed since I started this blog and committed myself to IELTS test studies.
It changed my behavior. Mainly because having clear study tasks, a target date, and the desire to do something I always delayed turned on my will to act.
Now it is clear to me that I never had a reason not to try. I was only afraid of an imaginary experience that I never had. How crazy does that sound? Committing to a routine, having the materials ready, and setting goals reminded me of when I needed to balance high school and swim training sessions. (Yeah, a long time ago, I used to spend hours in the pool).
I think every athlete struggles with the fact that training is always like shooting in the dark. Even if you train hard, dedicate yourself 100%, and take care of nutrition, rest, and sleep, you never know how all of this effort will turn out. Never! But I did it. I trained and dedicated myself because all I wanted was to be ready to compete on game day. Even if the result was not what I expected, the main reason for all the dedication was to commit to the process.
I had lost these memories and feelings of being a competitive swimmer. That version of myself didn’t resonate with who I had recently become… until I decided to take the test and commit to a purpose again. I don’t remember the last time I felt this good, and you know what? I’m taking advantage of all of it!
Yeah, I’ll see you in a minute!
