# Ganbare

_29 Jul 2025_

Japanese culture is one of my favorites. I have profound admiration for how the Japanese behave, do things, and relate to nature and the world. The language is incredibly rich, with around 50,000 kanji characters that can combine to form over 500,000 words!
I have a notebook where I jot down words that resonate deeply with me and reflect my current life situations. One such word that fits perfectly with my present circumstances is "Ganbare."
Recently, I was worried about wasting time circling around tasks instead of actually starting my IELTS exam preparation. However, I soon realized that this wasn't a waste of time at all. I'm investing time and effort now to avoid future stress. To stick with a plan, you first need to have one, and that plan must be carefully designed to cover every possible point to succeed.
In my previous post, I talked about transferring my ability to express myself through writing into my professional life. This led me to seek resources that could help me achieve this goal. Sometimes I feel lucky in my research; I discovered a book called "Business Communication and Character" by Amy Newman.
You guessed it... I bought it! Now, I'm feeling confident about the resources I have at my disposal. This confidence is making my doubtful thoughts quieter and quieter.
"Ganbare" means "Do your best," and that's exactly what I'm doing. It makes me feel connected to my essential self, the old me that I hoped to resemble again.
I will talk about the book and provide my impressions soon.
Thatâ€™s it for now. See you in a minute!
