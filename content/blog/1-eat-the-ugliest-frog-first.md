# “If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first”

Weird statement, got me thinking…
I get it when people use some crazy ways to express an idea, I prefer a more simple and straight approach.
After reading it, I had to track who wrote it… and guess what? I bought a book!
I bought it because the title was simple, straight… and even weirdest: “Eat that frog!” by Brian Tracy.
Worthed every penny, but I don't mean to talk about the book and what I learned from it right now, this post is to put into words why I started this blog.
As mentioned before in the first post, I am not a whole model when it comes to doing important tasks.
It is been a while since I wanted to do a proficiency exam, and as always, I wanted to do it but never decided what, how, or when. Shame on me…
And like every person who struggles with procrastination behavior, it get to the point where I was pissed with myself and decided to not work around it anymore.
So, the what... after researching the tests of English proficiency available, I decided on the IELTS test, and the reason was pretty simple, it is the most acceptable English proficiency test in the world (or not, who knows?!).
The how… oooh boy! For me, it is the most important topic and I’m still figuring it out, but as usual, will be by myself for now, and it is quite certain that I will use some well-known apps for English practice with native speakers.
Last but not least, the when... this brings one of the most important lessons of my life, I definitely need a target date!
That is December 13th, 2025.
It is way easier when I can set a timeline for every stage of my goals, and as a bloody procrastinator, it is unnegotiable!
Now the reason why I decided to start a blog... 
The last thing this nerd right here likes to do is, surprise surprise... writing!
I said in the first post no more bulsh*t... and I meant it!
This blog will be a way to commit to the task of writing, every day, in English (as a Brazilian, Portuguese is my mother tongue), also will be a log of my journey to become a better human being and to evaluate my learning progress along the way.
That’s it! This is me eating the ugliest frog first.
I will try to be less verbose in the next posts.
I see you in a minute!
