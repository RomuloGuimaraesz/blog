# Big No No

**24 Jul 2024**

I intended to start my IELTS preparation today, but quickly realized it was more challenging than I had anticipated. I felt quite naive. I researched the main topics for the writing test and was met with the harsh reality that it is much more comprehensive than I had imagined.<br>
But I didn’t panic. I kept researching and decided to meticulously document the two tasks that comprise the writing test to better understand them.<br>.
Moving on, I pinpointed the attributes of each one; nothing crazy, because I will make a more detailed report about it later. All of this helped me broaden my vision and decide to start with Task 2, which is essay writing. The reason was pretty straightforward: it carries the most weight in the scoring.<br>
Suddenly, I caught myself worried. Which topics could be adequate? Which would be important? Wait a minute… I asked myself what topics I am truly interested in and quickly realized they include science, technology, education, environment, arts, and politics. I decided to investigate in more detail what could be the structure of the questions. That was my day, filling out the blanks.<br>
That’s it, I see you in a minute!
