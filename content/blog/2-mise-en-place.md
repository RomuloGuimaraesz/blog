# Mise en place

**19 Jul 2024**

It's time to get the game plan!<br>
But first, I need to control entropy, and it is hard when I don’t acknowledge it because if I ignore the right details, more soon than late I will lose track.<br>
As I said before, starting this blog is part of my strategy of commitment to writing skills development, but it’s only 25% necessary to take the test.<br>
The other three areas that I need to cover are listening, reading and speaking <br> Being very straight to the point the speaking part will be a little overlooked for now, not because I think I can get by without problems but because I want to do it with a native speaker through an app.<br>
So, for the reading, I will be relying on news websites ( NPR and BBC ), and some more specific ones related to English skills development and learning, and also related to taking the IELTS test ( SUCCESS WITH IELTS and ENGVID ).<br>
The listening part I think is pretty straightforward for nonnative speakers because it all comes down to series and movies ( or maybe not, who knows?! ).<br>
The TV series I will be watching are House M.D ( the technical vocabulary of Physicians for me is not only interesting but very hard as well ), Fringe (which is my favorite one), and Billions ( for more business English vocabulary... hope so! ).<br>
Planning this preparation is getting me more confident, it is interesting how we can be super objective with a goal and a time target.<br>
I will be talking about the bibliography for the test in another post because I need to buy it and also is a dense subject on its own.<br>
That's it, I see you in a minute!
