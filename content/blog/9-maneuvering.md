# Maneuvering

_26 Jul 2025_

Well, I have to confess that today, I didn’t spend much time on preparation. The more time I spent on the documentation task, the more my dislike of writing kicked in. So, I managed to “surf” the internet (that’s some old-school slang there, kids, take notes!), researching materials I could use for preparation. I found a course on Udemy: IELTS 7 Plus: Complete IELTS Preparation.
Thinking about it, taking this course could diminish my uncertainty about doing the right thing. The course has a very high score and a big community, which is great for someone like me, new to this endeavor, who would like to ask for some clarification on certain topics.
The teacher seems to be highly qualified, and one thing that I considered very carefully was his track record. It was quite a surprise and one of the most unusual things for me when I found his Quora user profile. I didn’t expect to find it, but it makes total sense, as he could provide answers for those who were asking for help on the forum.
I think this was a good choice and an opportunity to evaluate the test's complexity from the perspective of an experienced teacher. I also intend to provide feedback about my impressions of the course. There are a lot of YouTube videos and other resources out there, but I believe in finding your way by scraping the internet.
Soon, I will give feedback about the course and my documentation prep for the test. Doing this maneuver today was necessary to keep my motivation going. As mentioned in previous posts, I'm more aware of my feelings and emotions, and this reflects on my decisions about what I'm going to do with my time and effort.
That’s it today, I see you in a minute!
