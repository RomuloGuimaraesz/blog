# Wrapping up - I

**23 Jul 2024**

One week as a blogger, gosh... who would have guessed? I could say that it's too soon to celebrate, but for someone who always had an excuse for not doing some kind of task, this milestone deserves a spotlight. The main lesson so far is: do things even if you don’t think you are ready! Writing down the simplest thoughts throughout the day to compose a bigger picture is no longer a big deal for me.
Even on busy days, I try to tune into my perception, sense the main flavor of my feelings, and decide what to write about later here.
Here’s a fun fact about me making up excuses: I always used to delay starting things by telling myself that I should wait for the beginning of the week, or some odd/even day. But this time, it just happened when it felt right, and there's joy in that.
I definitely want to prolong this feeling for the foreseeable future, not only because it gives me a ton of confidence, but I also know, now, that this is the right path I want to take.
Looking at the subjects of my posts, I wasn’t confident about giving them a personal tone, but I figured out that it should sound like me daily, always talking to myself, reflecting on my experiences, and trying to give the right amount of seriousness to what requires it.
It suits my inner state recently... focused but relaxed, taking care of what I should, and giving my best to it. 
I have never imagined taking the first step...
Well done, Rommy!
